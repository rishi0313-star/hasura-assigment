Describe any challenges you encountered and your troubleshooting steps to
address them.

  1. First issue that i faced was to import postgres file in my docker.
  The root cause of this issue was that already a postgres server was already running on port 5432.
  So on changing the port for my server it resolved the issue.

  2. Even after running the docker container, i was unable to run the localhost
The root cause of this issue might be that i have not added the admin secret key because of which local host was not starting
So on adding the admin secret key it resolved the issue.

  3. Importing the data on Hasura
Unable to connect the database, on changing the database url with correct username and password resolved the issue
